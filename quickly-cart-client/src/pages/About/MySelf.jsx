            <p className='text-slate-600'>I’m Murad — a passionate full-stack web developer from Bangladesh.
            With a deep interest in MERN stack development, I love creating interactive, real-world applications likechat apps, e-commerce platforms, and review-based services. <br />
            My journey began with curiosity and has turned into a passion for solving real-world problems through code. <br />
            I enjoy learning new technologies, experimenting with UI/UX, and continuously improving myself as a developer. <br />
            I believe in building with purpose — and Quicky Cart is a reflection of that belief.</p>
